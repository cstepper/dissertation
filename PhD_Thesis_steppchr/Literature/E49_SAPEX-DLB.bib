@article{AdelineK.R.M..2013,
 abstract = {Automatic shadow detection is a very important pre-processing step for many remote sensing applications, particularly for images acquired with high spatial resolution. In complex urban environments, shadows may occupy a significant portion of the image. Ignoring these regions would lead to errors in various applications, such as atmospheric correction and classification. To better understand the radiative impact of shadows, a physical study was conducted through the simulation of a synthetic urban canyon scene. Its results helped to explain the most common assumptions made on shadows from a physical point of view in the literature. With this understanding, state-of-the-art methods on shadow detection were surveyed and categorized into six classes: histogram thresholding, invariant color models, object segmentation, geometrical methods, physics-based methods, unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods. Among them, some methods were selected and tested on a large dataset of multispectral and hyperspectral airborne images with high spatial resolution. The dataset chosen contains a large variety of typical occidental urban scenes. The results were compared based on accurate reference shadow masks. In these experiments, histogram thresholding on RGB and NIR channels performed the best with an average accuracy of 92.5{\%}, followed by physics-based methods, such as Richter's method with 90.0{\%}. Finally, this paper analyzes and discusses the limits of these algorithms, concluding with some recommendations for shadow detection.},

@article{Ambroise.2002,
 abstract = {In the context of cancer diagnosis and treatment, we consider the problem of constructing an accurate prediction rule on the basis of a relatively small number of tumor tissue samples of known type containing the expression data on very many (possibly thousands) genes. Recently, results have been presented in the literature suggesting that it is possible to construct a prediction rule from only a few genes such that it has a negligible prediction error rate. However, in these results the test error or the leave-one-out cross-validated error is calculated without allowance for the selection bias. There is no allowance because the rule is either tested on tissue samples that were used in the first instance to select the genes being used in the rule or because the cross-validation of the rule is not external to the selection process; that is, gene selection is not performed in training the rule at each stage of the cross-validation process. We describe how in practice the selection bias can be assessed and corrected for by either performing a cross-validation or applying the bootstrap external to the selection process. We recommend using 10-fold rather than leave-one-out cross-validation, and concerning the bootstrap, we suggest using the so-called .632+ bootstrap error estimate designed to handle overfitted prediction rules. Using two published data sets, we demonstrate that when correction is made for the selection bias, the cross-validated error is no longer zero for a subset of only a few genes.},

@article{Baldeck.2014,
 abstract = {Progress in mapping plant species remotely with imaging spectroscopy data is limited by the traditional classification framework, which carries the requirement of exhaustively defining all classes (species) encountered in a landscape. As the research objective may be to map only one or a few species of interest, we need to explore alternative classification methods that may be used to more efficiently detect a single species. We compared the performance of three support vector machine (SVM) methods designed for single-class detection---binary (one-against-all) SVM, one-class SVM, and biased SVM---in detecting five focal tree and shrub species using data collected by the Carnegie Airborne Observatory over an African savanna. Prior to this comparison, we investigated the effects of training data amount and balance on binary SVM and evaluated alternative methods for tuning one-class and biased SVMs. A key finding was that biased SVM was generally best parameterized by crown-level cross validation paired with the tuning criterion proposed by Lee and Liu [1]. Among the different single-class methods, binary SVM showed the best overall performance (average F-scores 0.43--0.78 among species), whereas one-class SVM showed very poor performance (F-scores 0.09--0.46). However, biased SVM produced results similar to those obtained with binary SVM (F-scores 0.40--0.72), despite using labeled training data from only the focal class. Our results indicate that both binary and biased SVMs can work well for remote single-species detection, while both methods, particularly biased SVM, greatly reduce the amount of training data required compared with traditional multispecies classification.},

@article{BergenK.M..2009,
 abstract = {Biodiversity and habitat face increasing pressures due to human and natural influences that alter vegetation structure. Because of the inherent difficulty of measuring forested vegetation three-dimensional (3-D) structure on the ground, this important component of biodiversity and habitat has been, until recently, largely restricted to local measurements, or at larger scales to generalizations. New lidar and radar remote sensing instruments such as those proposed for spaceborne missions will provide the capability to fill this gap. This paper reviews the state of the art for incorporatinginformation on vegetation 3-D structure into biodiversity and habitat science and management approaches, with emphasis on use of lidar and radar data. First we review relationships between vegetation 3-D structure, biodiversity and habitat, and metrics commonly used to describe those relationships. Next, we review the technical capabilities of new lidar and radar sensors and their application to biodiversity and habitat studies to date. We then define variables that have been identified as both useful and feasible to retrieve from spaceborne lidar and radar observations and provide their accuracy and precision requirements. We conclude with a brief discussion of implications for spaceborne missions and research programs. The possibility to derive vegetation 3-D measurements from spaceborne active sensors and to integrate them into science and management comes at a critical juncture for global biodiversity conservation and opens new possibilities for advanced scientific analysis of habitat and biodiversity.},

@article{Clawges.2008,
 abstract = {Vegetation structure is an important factor that influences wildlife-habitat selection, reproduction, and survival. However, field-based measurements of vegetation structure can be time consuming, costly, and difficult to undertake in areas that are remote and/or contain rough terrain. Light detection and ranging (lidar) is an active remote sensing technology that can quantify three-dimensional vegetation structure over large areas and thus holds promise for examining wildlife-habitat relationships. We used discrete-return airborne lidar data acquired over the Black Hills Experimental Forest in South Dakota, USA in combination with field-collected vegetation and bird data to assess the utility of lidar data in quantifying vegetation structural characteristics that relate to avian diversity, density, and occurrence. Indices of foliage height diversity calculated from lidar data were positively and significantly correlated with indices of bird species diversity, with the highest correlations observed when foliage height diversity categories contained proportionally more foliage layers near the forest floor ({\&}lt; 5~m). In addition, lidar-derived indices of vegetation volume were significantly correlated with bird density. Using lidar-derived vegetation height data in combination with multispectral IKONOS data, we delineated five general habitat types within the study area according to the presence of prominent vegetation layers at lower levels of the forest and predominant tree type (deciduous or conifer). Habitat type delineations were tested by examining the occurrence and relative density of two bird species common to the study area that prefer lower level vegetation for foraging and nesting. Dark-eyed Juncos were significantly associated with the 0.5--2.0~m high vegetation layer in pine-dominated stands, and Warbling Vireos were significantly associated with this same layer in aspen-dominated stands. These results demonstrate that discrete-return lidar can be an effective tool to remotely quantify vegetation structural attributes important to birds, and may be enhanced when used in combination with spectral data.},

 abstract = {Aerial photography has been routinely used for several decades by natural resource scientists and managers to map and monitor the condition of forested landscapes. Recently, along with the emergence of concepts in managing forests as ecosystems, has come a significant shift in emphasis from smaller to larger spatial scales and the widespread use of geographic information systems. These developments have precipitated an increasing need for vegetation information derived from other remote sensing imagery, especially digital data acquired from high-elevation aircraft and satellite platforms. This paper introduces fundamental concepts in digital remote sensing and describes numerous applications of the technology. The intent is to provide a balanced, nontechnical view, discussing the shortcomings, successes, and future potential for digital remote sensing of forested ecosystems.},

 abstract = {Machine learning approaches such as random forest have increased for the spatial modeling and mapping of continuous variables. Random forest is a non-parametric ensemble approach, and unlike traditional regression approaches there is no direct quantification of prediction error. Understanding prediction uncertainty is important when using model-based continuous maps as inputs to other modeling applications such as fire modeling. Here we use a Monte Carlo approach to quantify prediction uncertainty for random forest regression models. We test the approach by simulating maps of dependent and independent variables with known characteristics and comparing actual errors with prediction errors. Our approach produced conservative prediction intervals across most of the range of predicted values. However, because the Monte Carlo approach was data driven, prediction intervals were either too wide or too narrow in sparse parts of the prediction distribution. Overall, our approach provides reasonable estimates of prediction uncertainty for random forest regression models.},

We provide the first spatially continuous map of forest tree density at a global scale.

Of these trees, approximately 1.39 trillion exist in tropical and subtropical forests, with 0.74 trillion in boreal regions and 0.61 trillion in temperate regions. Biome-level trends in tree density demonstrate the importance of climate and topography in controlling local tree densities at finer scales, as well as the overwhelming effect of humans across most of the world. Based on our projected tree densities, we estimate that over 15 billion trees are cut down each year, and the global number of trees has fallen by approximately 46{\%} since the start of human civilization.},

 abstract = {This study evaluated the possibility of measuring the height to the base of the live crown and the height to the median of canopy elements with airborne scanning LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) in a simple, even-aged stand of loblolly pine. The first step in determining these heights was fitting truncated Weibull functions to the vertical distribution of elevations where discrete laser pulses were reflected from the dominant canopy strata. The height to the canopy median was defined as height at the median of the distribution. The height to the base of the live crown was defined as the height where the upper tail the distribution asymptotes to zero returns. Ground-based and LiDAR-based estimates of the canopy median differed by 0.3 m and were not significantly different (P = 0.23). Ground- and LiDAR-based estimates of the base of the live crown differed by 0.6 m and were significantly different (P = 0.03). LiDAR-based estimates of the canopy median exhibited positive bias over most of the range of field-measured values. Analyses of the LiDAR data resulted in overestimating the height to the canopy base over most of the range in field-measured values; however, the difference between ground and LiDAR-based estimates were negatively correlated with ground-based measurements. Average tree diameter was calculated with LiDAR-generated heights to the canopy median and to the base of the live crown. The overall average diameter was not statistically different from the overall quadratic mean diameter measured on the ground, demonstrating the possible utility of these canopy variables to forest managers working with simple stands such as plantations.},

 abstract = {Quantification of spatial and temporal changes in forest cover is an essential component of forest monitoring programs. Due to its cloud free capability, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an ideal source of information on forest dynamics in countries with near-constant cloud-cover. However, few studies have investigated the use of SAR for forest cover estimation in landscapes with highly sparse and fragmented forest cover. In this study, the potential use of L-band SAR for forest cover estimation in two regions (Longford and Sligo) in Ireland is investigated and compared to forest cover estimates derived from three national (Forestry2010, Prime2, National Forest Inventory), one pan-European (Forest Map 2006) and one global forest cover (Global Forest Change) product. Two machine-learning approaches (Random Forests and Extremely Randomised Trees) are evaluated. Both Random Forests and Extremely Randomised Trees classification accuracies were high (98.1-98.5{\%}), with differences between the two classifiers being minimal ({\textless}0.5{\%}). Increasing levels of post classification filtering led to a decrease in estimated forest area and an increase in overall accuracy of SAR-derived forest cover maps. All forest cover products were evaluated using an independent validation dataset. For the Longford region, the highest overall accuracy was recorded with the Forestry2010 dataset (97.42{\%}) whereas in Sligo, highest overall accuracy was obtained for the Prime2 dataset (97.43{\%}), although accuracies of SAR-derived forest maps were comparable. Our findings indicate that spaceborne radar could aid inventories in regions with low levels of forest cover in fragmented landscapes. The reduced accuracies observed for the global and pan-continental forest cover maps in comparison to national and SAR-derived forest maps indicate that caution should be exercised when applying these datasets for national reporting.},

 abstract = {Agricultural terraces are features that provide a number of ecosystem services. As a result, their maintenance is supported by measures established by the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). In the framework of CAP implementation and monitoring, there is a current and future need for the development of robust, repeatable and cost-effective methodologies for the automatic identification and monitoring of these features at farm scale. This is a complex task, particularly when terraces are associated to complex vegetation cover patterns, as happens with permanent crops (e.g. olive trees). In this study we present a novel methodology for automatic and cost-efficient identification of terraces using only imagery from commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) cameras on board unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Using state-of-the-art computer vision techniques, we generated orthoimagery and digital surface models (DSMs) at 11~cm spatial resolution with low user intervention. In a second stage, these data were used to identify terraces using a multi-scale object-oriented classification method. Results show the potential of this method even in highly complex agricultural areas, both regarding DSM reconstruction and image classification. The UAV-derived DSM had a root mean square error (RMSE) lower than 0.5~m when the height of the terraces was assessed against field GPS data. The subsequent automated terrace classification yielded an overall accuracy of 90{\%} based exclusively on spectral and elevation data derived from the UAV imagery.},

 abstract = {The ratio between additive and original versions of Reineke's stand density index (SDI) has been used as a descriptor of stand structural complexity. That ratio also can be informative for designing efficient sampling methods and for the design of silvicultural experiments. Previous analyses of this ratio have assumed a diameter distribution without truncation, such that trees from zero to infinite dbh are possible. Truncation of the diameter distribution, e.g., by tallying only trees larger than some minimum dbh, moves the ratio much closer to one when the stand has a classic balanced uneven-aged structure. Minimum values of the ratio are found not with classic reverse-J distributions, but with sharply bimodal distributions that might be typical of a two-cohort stand. The implications for the use of novel sampling methods and for experimental designs to test whether the additive or original SDI provides better prediction in irregular stands are discussed.},

 abstract = {Quantifying stand density is important for accurate prediction of net biomass and carbon accumulation, for estimating growth and mortality risks of trees, stands, and regions, and for the management of forests for multiple goods and services. Building on previous work relating maximum stand density to wood specific gravity, we develop a stand density equation for the mixed species forests of the northeastern United States using data from the US Forest Service, Forest Inventory and Analysis program. We used quantile regression, in concert with a quantile selection and evaluation procedure, to ensure conformity between our density measure and previously developed guidance for well-studied stand types. The resulting strictly additive relative density measure appears to provide reasonable prediction of maximum density even for plantations of exotic conifers in the region. The results suggest that maximum stand densities after accounting for wood specific gravity may be lower in northeastern North America than in the south or west.},

 abstract = {Information on current forest condition is essential to assess and characterize resources and to support resource management and policy decisions. The 1998 Farm Bill mandates the US Forest Service to conduct annual inventories to provide annual updates of each state's forest. In annual inventories, the sample size of 1 year (panel) is only a portion of the full sample and therefore the precision of the estimations for any given year is low. To achieve higher precision, the Forest Inventory and Analysis program uses a moving average (MA), which combines the data of multiple panels, as default estimator. The MA can result in biased estimates of current conditions and alternative methods are sought. Alternatives to MA have not yet been explored in the Pacific Northwest. Data from Oregon and Washington national forests were used to examine a weighted moving average (WMA) and three imputation approaches: most similar neighbor, gradient nearest neighbor, and randomForest (RF). Using the most recent measurements of the variables of interest as ancillary variables, RF provided almost unbiased estimates that were comparable to those of the MA and WMA estimators in terms of root mean square error.},

 abstract = {Vegetated coastal dunes grow as a result of feedbacks between vegetation and sand transport. Observing the coevolution of vegetation and the sand surface is therefore critical for unraveling the dynamics of coastal dune growth. Capturing synchronous topography and photography at high spatial resolution and high temporal frequency using traditional techniques (airplane-based aerial photography, LiDAR) is expensive and time-consuming. Structure-from-Motion combined with Multiview-Stereo, a photogrammetry workflow that uses low-cost, consumer-grade equipment, is an economical alternative to traditional collection methods. This workflow still requires the definition of ground control points (GCPs) --- locations with known coordinates --- to develop accurate digital surface models. In this contribution we address how the number of GCPs used impacts the accuracy of digital surface models. We flew a 9-foot single-line delta kite attached to a consumer-grade camera to photograph the beach and dune of Hog Island, VA, a site that contains 178 high precision GCPs over an area of {\~{}}0.025 km2 (as part of an ongoing field experiment). We then processed the 318 photographs using Agisoft Photoscan and compared the elevation accuracy of digital surface models rendered using SfM, with varying GCPs, to points surveyed by a total station. Our results suggest that there is `diminishing returns' when greater than 10 GCPs are used. Results from this study can be used to inform future Structure-from-Motion studies using UAVs or kites in flat, low-sloping coastal environments.},

@book{Everitt.2011,
 abstract = {{\dq}The majority of data sets collected by researchers in all disciplines are multivariate, meaning that several measurements, observations, or recordings are taken on each of the units in the data set. These units might be human subjects, archaeological artifacts, countries, or a vast variety of other things. In a few cases, it may be sensible to isolate each variable and study it separately, but in most instances all the variables need to be examined simultaneously in order to fully grasp the structure and key features of the data. For this purpose, one or another method of multivariate analysis might be helpful, and it is with such methods that this book is largely concerned. Multivariate analysis includes methods both for describing and exploring such data and for making formal inferences about them. The aim of all the techniques is, in general sense, to display or extract the signal in the data in the presence of noise and to find out what the data show us in the midst of their apparent chaos. An Introduction to Applied Multivariate Analysis with R explores the correct application of these methods so as to extract as much information as possible from the data at hand, particularly as some type of graphical representation, via the R software. Throughout the book, the authors give many examples of R code used to apply the multivariate techniques to multivariate data.{\dq}--Publisher's description.},

@article{Feilhauer.2014,
 abstract = {Questions

Can we map both discrete Natura 2000 habitat types and their floristic variability using multispectral remote sensing data? How do these data perform compared to full range imaging spectroscopy data? Which spectral and spatial characteristics of remote sensing data are important for accurate mapping of habitats and their variability?



Location

A mire complex in Bavaria, southern Germany.



Methods

To compare the performance of imaging spectroscopy and multispectral remote sensing data, airborne spectroscopy data (AISA Dual) were spectrally and spatially resampled to the characteristics of two state-of-the-art multispectral sensors (RapidEye and Sentinel-2), resulting in three data sets with different spectral and spatial resolution. Based on the three data sets, we used a combination of field surveys, ordination techniques (non-metric multidimensional scaling), as well as regression and classification techniques (Random Forests) to derive maps of the distribution of Natura 2000 habitat types and their compositional variability. Subsequently, we analysed effects of the spatial and spectral image resolution and spectral coverage on the mapping performance.



Results

Mire habitat types and their floristic composition could be accurately mapped with multispectral remote sensing data. In the case of accentuated floristic differences between habitats, the fits of the models for the three sensors differed only marginally. These effects and the importance of the spatial resolution are discussed.



Conclusions

The results are encouraging and confirm that multispectral data may allow the combined mapping of discrete habitats and their local variability. Still, questions with respect to the transferability of the approach to habitat types with less pronounced spectral differences, and with regard to bridging the gap between fine-scale vegetation records and coarse resolution imagery remain open.},

difference between the two elevation values (i.e., canopy surface-ground

height, and a canopy height profile was constructed from these data. The

canopy structure in the 4-ha plot that was estimated in this way was

compared with that obtained by two ground observation methods, i.e., the

canopy (vegetation) height profile method and the canopy coverage census

method. Large gaps were adequately detected by the aerial photograph

method, but small gaps were less often detected. Gap size distribution

obtained by the aerial photograph method was similar to that observed on

the ground, and was a function of gap depth. This study indicates that

if a detailed topographic map can be made, the canopy height profile

derived from aerial photography can be effective in analyzing the canopy

structure of evergreen forests, such as tropical rain forests, over

large areas.},

@article{Garabedian.2014,
 abstract = {Abstract

Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology has the potential to radically alter the way researchers and managers collect data on wildlife--habitat relationships. To date, the technology has fostered several novel approaches to characterizing avian habitat, but has been limited by the lack of detailed LiDAR-habitat attributes relevant to species across a continuum of spatial grain sizes and habitat requirements. We demonstrate a novel three-step approach for using LiDAR data to evaluate habitat based on multiple habitat attributes and accounting for their influence at multiple grain sizes using federally endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (RCW; Picoides borealis) foraging habitat data from the Savannah River Site (SRS) in South Carolina, USA. First, we used high density LiDAR data (10 returns/m2) to predict detailed forest attributes at 20-m resolution across the entire SRS using a complementary application of nonlinear seemingly unrelated regression and multiple linear regression models. Next, we expanded on previous applications of LiDAR by constructing 95{\%} joint prediction confidence intervals to quantify prediction error at various spatial aggregations and habitat thresholds to determine a biologically and statistically meaningful grain size. Finally, we used aggregations of 20-m cells and associated confidence interval boundaries to demonstrate a new approach to produce maps of RCW foraging habitat conditions based on the guidelines described in the species' recovery plan. Predictive power (R2) of regression models developed to populate raster layers ranged from 0.34 to 0.81, and prediction error decreased as aggregate size increased, but minimal reductions in prediction error were observed beyond 0.64-ha (4 $\times$ 4 20-m cells) aggregates. Mapping habitat quality while accounting for prediction error provided a robust method to determine the potential range of habitat conditions and specific attributes that were limiting in terms of the amount of suitable habitat. The sequential steps of our analytical approach provide a useful framework to extract detailed and reliable habitat attributes for a forest-dwelling habitat specialist, broadening the potential to apply LiDAR in conservation and management of wildlife populations.},

@article{Gatziolis.2015,
 abstract = {Detailed, precise, three-dimensional (3D) representations of individual trees are a prerequisite for an accurate assessment of tree competition, growth, and morphological plasticity. Until recently, our ability to measure the dimensionality, spatial arrangement, shape of trees, and shape of tree components with precision has been constrained by technological and logistical limitations and cost. Traditional methods of forest biometrics provide only partial measurements and are labor intensive. Active remote technologies such as LiDAR operated from airborne platforms provide only partial crown reconstructions. The use of terrestrial LiDAR is laborious, has portability limitations and high cost. In this work we capitalized on recent improvements in the capabilities and availability of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), light and inexpensive cameras, and developed an affordable method for obtaining precise and comprehensive 3D models of trees and small groups of trees. The method employs slow-moving UAVs that acquire images along predefined trajectories near and around targeted trees, and computer vision-based approaches that process the images to obtain detailed tree reconstructions. After we confirmed the potential of the methodology via simulation we evaluated several UAV platforms, strategies for image acquisition, and image processing algorithms. We present an original, step-by-step workflow which utilizes open source programs and original software. We anticipate that future development and applications of our method will improve our understanding of forest self-organization emerging from the competition among trees, and will lead to a refined generation of individual-tree-based forest models.},

@article{Goetz.2007,
 abstract = {Habitat heterogeneity has long been recognized as a fundamental variable indicative of species diversity, in terms of both richness and abundance. Satellite remote sensing data sets can be useful for quantifying habitat heterogeneity across a range of spatial scales. Past remote sensing analyses of species diversity have largely been limited to correlative studies based on the use of vegetation indices or derived land cover maps. A relatively new form of laser remote sensing (lidar) provides another means to acquire information on habitat heterogeneity. Here we examine the efficacy of lidar metrics of canopy structural diversity as predictors of bird species richness in the temperate forests of Maryland, USA. Canopy height, topography and the vertical distribution of canopy elements were derived from lidar imagery of the Patuxent National Wildlife Refuge and compared to bird survey data collected at referenced grid locations. The canopy vertical distribution information was consistently found to be the strongest predictor of species richness, and this was predicted best when stratified into guilds dominated by forest, scrub, suburban and wetland species. Similar lidar variables were selected as primary predictors across guilds. Generalized linear and additive models, as well as binary hierarchical regression trees produced similar results. The lidar metrics were also consistently better predictors than traditional remotely sensed variables such as canopy cover, indicating that lidar provides a valuable resource for biodiversity research applications.},

 abstract = {Large-scale information on habitat suitability is indispensable for planning management actions to further endangered species with large-spatial requirements. So far, remote sensing based habitat variables mostly included environmental and land cover data derived from passive sensors, but lacked information on vegetation structure. This is a serious constraint for the management of endangered species with specific structural requirements. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR), in contrast to passive remote sensing techniques, may bridge this gap in structural information at the landscape scale. We investigated the potential of LiDAR data to quantify habitat suitability for capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), an endangered forest grouse in Central Europe, in a forest reserve of 17.7 km2. We used continuous variables of horizontal and vertical stand structure from first and last pulse LiDAR data and presence--absence information from field work to model habitat suitability with generalized linear models (GLM). The two final habitat suitability models explained the observed presence--absence pattern moderately well (AUC of 0.71 and 0.77) with horizontal structure explaining better than vertical structure. Relative tree canopy cover was the most important variable with intermediate values indicating highest habitat suitability. As such, LiDAR allowed us to translate the results from habitat modeling at the landscape scale to effective management recommendations at the local scale at a level of detail that hitherto was unavailable for large areas. LiDAR thus enabled us to integrate individual habitat preferences at the scale of entire populations and thus offers great potential for effective habitat monitoring and management of endangered species.},

 abstract = {Quantification of global forest change has been lacking despite the recognized importance of forest ecosystem services. In this study, Earth observation satellite data were used to map global forest loss (2.3 million square kilometers) and gain (0.8 million square kilometers) from 2000 to 2012 at a spatial resolution of 30 meters. The tropics were the only climate domain to exhibit a trend, with forest loss increasing by 2101 square kilometers per year. Brazil's well-documented reduction in deforestation was offset by increasing forest loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia, Angola, and elsewhere. Intensive forestry practiced within subtropical forests resulted in the highest rates of forest change globally. Boreal forest loss due largely to fire and forestry was second to that in the tropics in absolute and proportional terms. These results depict a globally consistent and locally relevant record of forest change.},

With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics.{\dq}--Jacket.},

 abstract = {Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is increasingly used to map terrain and vegetation. Data collection is expensive, but costs are reduced when multiple products are derived from each mission. We examined how well low-density leaf-off LiDAR, originally flown for terrain mapping, quantified hardwood forest structure. We measured tree density, dbh, basal area, mean tree height, Lorey's mean tree height, and sawtimber and pulpwood volume at 114 field plots. Using univariate and multivariate linear regression models, we related field data to LiDAR return heights. We compared models using all LiDAR returns and only first returns. First-return univariate models explained more variability than all-return models; however, the differences were small for multivariate models. Multiple regression models had {\textless}i xmlns={\dq}http://pub2web.metastore.ingenta.com/ns/{\dq}{\textgreater}R{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sup xmlns={\dq}http://pub2web.metastore.ingenta.com/ns/{\dq}{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} values of 65{\%} for sawtimber and pulpwood volume, 63{\%} for Lorey's mean tree height, 55{\%} for mean tree height, 48{\%} for mean dbh, 46{\%} for basal area, and 13{\%} for tree density. However, the standard error of the mean for predictions ranged between 1 and 4{\%}, and this level of error is well within levels needed for broad-scale forest assessments. Our results suggest that low-density LiDAR intended for terrain mapping is valuable for broad-scale hardwood forest inventories.},

 abstract = {This proceedings contains 82 papers dealing with the development and application of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) for forest assessment and inventory. Presentations cover all forms of laser system, from all possible platforms, and across a full range of forest applications. The conference has six session themes: forestry applications and inventory; data fusion; ecological applications and habitat mapping; waveform LiDAR; algorithm and techniques development; and terrestrial laser scanning and laser cameras. It details the state-of-the-art in laser systems and data processing techniques to meet a range of information needs. The conference aims to encourage new and stronger linkages between LiDAR practitioners, and in particular between researchers, data providers and end-users of derived products.},

 abstract = {Foresters are increasingly interested in remote sensing data because they provide an overview of landscape conditions, which is impractical with field sample data alone. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) provides exceptional spatial detail of forest structure, but difficulties in

processing LiDAR data have limited their application beyond the research community. Another obstacle to operational use of LiDAR data has been the high cost of data collection. Our objectives in this study were to summarize, at the stand level, both LiDAR- and Landsat (satellite)-based predictions

of some common structural and volume attributes and to compare the cost of obtaining such summaries with those obtained through traditional stand exams. We found that the accuracy and cost of a LiDAR-based inventory summarized at the stand level was comparable to traditional stand exams for

structural attributes. However, the LiDAR data were able to provide information across a much larger area than the stand exams alone.},

@article{Hyde.2006,
 abstract = {Measurements of forest structure are important for wildlife habitat management. An optimal strategy for mapping forest structure would include detailed measurements of the vertical dimension, which are traditionally provided by field sampling, together with the broad spatial coverage afforded by remote sensing. While no single sensor is capable of delivering this at the present time, it should be possible to combine information from multiple sensors to achieve a reasonable approximation. In this study, we compare estimates of forest structural metrics derived from remote sensing to measurements obtained in the field (large tree maximum canopy height, mean canopy height, standard deviation canopy height, and biomass). We then statistically combine structural information from LiDAR, RaDAR, and passive optical sensors in an attempt to improve accuracy of our estimates. The results of this study indicate that LiDAR is the best single sensor for estimating canopy height and biomass. The addition of ETM+ metrics significantly improved LiDAR estimates of large tree structure, while Quickbird and InSAR/SAR improved estimates either marginally or not at all. The combination of all sensors was more accurate than LiDAR alone, but only marginally better than the combination of LiDAR and ETM+. Structure metrics from LiDAR and RaDAR are essentially redundant, as are ETM+ and Quickbird.},

@article{Lesak.2011,
 abstract = {Conservation of biodiversity requires information at many spatial scales in order to detect and preserve habitat for many species, often simultaneously. Vegetation structure information is particularly important for avian habitat models and has largely been unavailable for large areas at the desired resolution. Airborne LiDAR, with its combination of relatively broad coverage and fine resolution provides existing new opportunities to map vegetation structure and hence avian habitat. Our goal was to model the richness of forest songbirds using forest structure information obtained from LiDAR data. In deciduous forests of southern Wisconsin, USA, we used discrete-return airborne LiDAR to derive forest structure metrics related to the height and density of vegetation returns, as well as composite variables that captured major forest structural elements. We conducted point counts to determine total forest songbird richness and the richness of foraging, nesting, and forest edge-related habitat guilds. A suite of 35 LiDAR variables were used to model bird species richness using best-subsets regression and we used hierarchical partitioning analysis to quantify the explanatory power of each variable in the multivariate models. Songbird species richness was correlated most strongly with LiDAR variables related to canopy and midstory height and midstory density (R2 = 0.204, p {\&}lt; 0.001). Richness of species that nest in the midstory was best explained by canopy height variables (R2 = 0.197, p {\&}lt; 0.001). Species that forage on the ground responded to mean canopy height and the height of the lower canopy (R2 = 0.149, p {\&}lt; 0.005) while aerial foragers had higher richness where the canopy was tall and dense and the midstory more sparse (R2 = 0.216, p {\&}lt; 0.001). Richness of edge-preferring species was greater where there were fewer vegetation returns but higher density in the understory (R2 = 0.153, p {\&}lt; 0.005). Forest interior specialists responded positively to a tall canopy, developed midstory, and a higher proportion of vegetation returns (R2 = 0.195, p {\&}lt; 0.001). LiDAR forest structure metrics explained between 15 and 20{\%} of the variability in richness within deciduous forest songbird communities. This variability was associated with vertical structure alone and shows how LiDAR can provide a source of complementary predictive data that can be incorporated in models of wildlife habitat associations across broad geographical extents.},

Measured timber volume was regressed against the cross-sectional area of an AOL-generated profile of forest at the same location. The AOL profile area was found to be a very significant variable in the estimation of gross-merchantable timber volume. Significant improvements were obtained when the data were stratified by species. The overall R-squared value obtained was 0.921 with the regression significant at the one percent level.},

 abstract = {{\dq}Discover what you can do with R! Introducing the R system, covering standard regression methods, then tackling more advanced topics, this book guides users through the practical, powerful tools that the R system provides. The emphasis is on hands-on analysis, graphical display, and interpretation of data. The many worked examples, from real-world research, are accompanied by commentary on what is done and why. The companion website has code and datasets, allowing readers to reproduce all analyses, along with solutions to selected exercises and updates. Assuming basic statistical knowledge and some experience with data analysis (but not R), the book is ideal for research scientists, final-year undergraduate or graduate-level students of applied statistics, and practising statisticians. It is both for learning and for reference. This third edition expands upon topics such as Bayesian inference for regression, errors in variables, generalized linear mixed models, and random forests{\dq}--Provided by publisher.},

 abstract = {The goal of this study was to compare percentile based distribution methods and the Weibull distribution method in predicting the stand characteristics of forests with great variability in their diameter distribution. Stand structure characteristics were compared between thinned and unthinned stands dominated by Scots pine. The thinned forests were located in eastern Finland, while the unthinned natural forests were located in Republic of Karelia and Leningrad district, Russian Federation. Each data sets included 49 stands.

The diameter distributions were more heterogeneous in the unthinned stands. Most of the thinned stands formed unimodal distributions. Among the unthinned stands, decreasing, multi-modal and irregular forms of diameter distributions were also found. In these data, percentile based distribution methods proved to be considerably more effective in predicting the diameter distribution than the Weibull distribution method. With the percentile based distribution method it was also possible to reproduce considerably varying shapes of diameter distributions.},

@article{McDermid.2009,
 abstract = {Researchers and managers undertaking wildlife habitat assessments commonly require spatially explicit environmental map layers such as those derived from forest inventory and remote sensing. However, end users of geospatial products must often make choices regarding the source and level of detail required for characterizing habitat elements, with few published resources available for guidance. We appraised three environmental data sources that represent options often available to researchers and managers in wildlife ecological studies: (i) a pre-existing forest inventory; (ii) a general-purpose, single-attribute remote sensing land cover map; and (iii) a specific-purpose, multi-attribute remote sensing database. The three information sources were evaluated with two complementary analyses: the first designed to appraise levels of map quality (assessed on the basis of accuracy, vagueness, completion, consistency, level of measurement, and detail) and the second designed to assess their relative capacity to explain patterns of grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) telemetry locations across a 100,000-km2 study area in west-central Alberta, Canada. We found the forest inventory database to be reasonably functional in its ability to support resource selection analysis in regions where coverage was available, but overall, the data suffered from quality issues related to completeness accuracy, and consistency. The general-purpose remote sensing land cover product ranked higher in terms of overall map quality, but demonstrated a lower capacity for explaining observed patterns of grizzly bear habitat use. We found the best results using the specific-purpose, multi-attribute remote sensing database, and recommend that similar information sources be used as the foundation for wildlife habitat studies whenever possible, particularly those involving large areas that span jurisdictional boundaries.},

 abstract = {This study applies an approach based on stochastic geometry for retrieval of forest characteristics from airborne laser scanning (ALS) in two situations: 1) without ground-measured training data and 2) with training data. The applied model treats the ALS echo heights as an outcome of a random process, expressing the observed heights of canopy envelope as a function of stand density, the parameters of the tree height distribution, and the shape of the individual tree crown. The model was applied to a eucalyptus plantation dataset with known spacing, where the main interest was to estimate the plot-specific tree height distribution. Estimation without training data resulted in RMSEs of 2.9 and 0.9 m for mean and dominant heights, respectively. Estimation using training data resulted in RMSE's of 1.4 and 0.8 m, respectively. In both cases, the estimates of dominant height were more accurate than with the reference method, but the estimates of mean height were less accurate (area-based approach; RMSEs 1.1 and 0.9 m, respectively). The model-based method was robust to substantial decrease in echo density from 1.4 echoes/m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} to 0.14 echoes/m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}.},

@article{Moeur.1995,
 abstract = {To model ecosystem functioning for landscape design, analysts would like detailed data about each parcel of land in the landscape. Usually, only information of low resolution is available for the entire area, supplemented by detailed information for a sample of the parcels. These sample data, usually obtained through two-phase sampling, provide initial values of important design elements for dynamic, often nonlinear, models of ecosystem functioning. However, to represent the contribution of the nonsampled portions of the landscape to ecosystem functioning, it would be convenient to be able to operate as if the detailed design information were available for each and every parcel in the analysis. Inference procedures to complete the design information for the unsampled parcels have usually followed the techniques of stratified or regression sampling. These procedures have been developed with regard to their efficiency for estimating population means and totals rather than for their utility to model ecosystem functioning and response to intervention. Stratified sampling or regression estimates therefore do not retain the complex relationships between multivariate design attributes. We present a new multivariate inference procedure for use in such circumstances. In place of estimating design attributes element-by-element in a traditional sense for each first-phase observation, the procedure simply chooses the most similar parcel from the set of parcels with detailed examinations to act as its stand-in. The stand-in is chosen on the basis of a similarity measure that summarizes the multivariate relationships between the set of low resolution indicator attributes and the set of detailed design attributes derived from the second-phase sample. Canonical correlation analysis is used to derive a similarity function for this procedure, which we call {\dq}Most Similar Neighbor Inference.{\dq} We compared most similar neighbor estimates for a multivariate forest inventory to estimates from regression, stratified sampling, and a Swedish National Forest Survey method. The indicator attributes were recorded from stand records, maps, and aerial photographs, while the design attributes were stand yield characteristics derived from on-the-ground inventories. The most similar neighbor estimates have prediction errors that are comparable in magnitude to the traditional estimates for easy-to-predict design attributes. Thus, most similar neighbor inference should be expected to perform almost as well as regression in sampling contexts requiring estimates of population means or totals. More importantly, the most similar neighbor procedure more closely reproduces the covariance structure of the design attributes. Preserving the relationships among design attributes is a vital feature when the purpose of the modeling is to evaluate management options. Furthermore, because most similar neighbor is an exact interpolator, estimates derived from it are consistent in a finite population sense. For. Sci. 41(2):337-359.},

 abstract = {1. Effective biodiversity management can only be implemented if data are available on assemblage--environment relationships. The level of detail needs to be relevant to the scale of planning and decision making. A number of remote-sensing methods are available, but there are few studies that link information collected at both landscape and local scales. This is particularly true for arthropods even though these organisms are ecologically very important. 2. We assessed the predictive power of habitat variables measured by airborne laser scanning (light detection and ranging; LiDAR) to model the activity, richness and composition of assemblages of forest-dwelling beetles. We compared the results with data acquired using conventional field methods. We sampled beetles with pitfall traps and flight-interception traps at 171 sampling stations along an elevation gradient in a montane forest. 3. We found a high predictive power of LiDAR-derived variables, which captured most of the predictive power of variables measured in ground surveys. In particular, mean body size and species composition of assemblages showed considerable predictability using LiDAR-derived variables. The differences in the predictability of species richness and diversity of assemblages between trap types can be explained by sample size. We expect predictabilities with R2 of up to 0·6 for samples with 250 individuals on average. 4. The statistical response of beetle data and the ecological interpretability of results showed that airborne laser scanning can be used for cost-effective mapping (LiDAR~:~field survey~:~beetles 15~:~100~:~260~{\text\euro}~ha$-$1) of biodiversity even in remote mountain areas and in structurally complex habitats, such as forests. 5. Synthesis and applications.~The strong relationship between characteristics of beetle assemblages to variables derived by laser scanning provides an opportunity to link data from local ground surveys of hyperdiverse taxa to data collected remotely at the landscape scale. This will enable conservation managers to evaluate habitats, define hotspots or map activity, richness and composition of assemblages at scales relevant for planning and management. In addition to the large area that can be sampled remotely, the grain of the data allows a single tree to be identified, which opens up the possibility of planning management actions at local scales.},

 abstract = {Modelling and forecasting of the distribution and abundance of organisms using environmental variables is a major focus of applied ecological research. High-resolution airborne laser scanning is a recently developed remote-sensing method that provides data that can be used as surrogates for the vertical structure of the vegetation. These data can be used for modelling the occurrence and abundance of species or species assemblages. Until now, few studies evaluated the potential of these data for use in such models, or compared the suitability of data obtained by airborne systems with data gained by alternative methods. To fill part of this gap, we used forest passerine bird species to evaluate airborne laser scanning data for statistical modelling of potential bird abundances and composition of assemblages. Birds were counted in a mixed montane forest, on 223 1-ha plots along four transects. In the same period, these areas were scanned using Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) to characterise canopy structure. Additionally, we used visual interpretations of aerial photographs and field measurements on the same plots to derive habitat variables for comparison. We found clear correlations between the LiDAR variables and the other two variable sets using canonical correlation analysis. With a few exceptions, predictive power of the LiDAR data set for modelling abundances of single species, with up to 40{\%} explained variance, was superior to that of the other two data sets. Models agreed with existing ecological knowledge for these species. For modelling of species composition with redundancy analysis, LiDAR was also superior to the other two data sets with more than 20{\%} unique contribution to the explained variance. Our results clearly showed that LiDAR provides valuable data for describing and modelling single species as well as assemblages of forest organisms.},

 abstract = {Abstract

For several decades, forest managers have considered the effects of logging on the habitat quality of forests for bats. Concern about bat activity above the canopy has now been raised owing to rapidly increasing demands for wind energy and the ensuing placement of wind turbines over forests. We investigated the little-explored vertical stratification of bat activity in forests at ten sites on ten nights using five simultaneous bat-call recorders placed from near ground up to above the canopy. The vegetation-free space at each recorder position was measured with terrestrial laser scanning. We predicted that (1) the activity of Pipistrellus, nyctaloids and the open-habitat foraging guild will increase in mature forests with increasing height above ground, independent of local vegetation density and temperature, and (2) the activity of Myotis and the edge-habitat-foraging guild will decrease with height but increase with local low vegetation density. Our generalized linear mixed model indicated that nyctaloids, Pipistrellus and open-habitat foragers were increasingly active in higher strata, independent of temperature and local vegetation density. Activity of Myotis and Pipistrellus species and the edge-habitat foragers was higher along interior edges of forests. The activity of single species in the above-canopy stratum could be explained well by their Europe-wide wind-turbine risk assessment. Thus, we conclude that open-habitat bat species and Pipistrellus species not only forage regularly in clearings or forest meadows, but also above the canopy of closed mature stands, behaviour that may put them at risk from turbines.},

 abstract = {Abstract

Better spatial information on the global distribution of croplands and pastures is urgently needed. Without reliable cropland--pasture separation it will be impossible to retrieve high-quality information on agricultural expansion or land use intensification, and on related ecosystem service provision. In this context, the savanna biome is critically important, but information on land use and land cover (LULC) is notoriously inaccurate in these areas. This is due to pronounced spatial--temporal dynamics of agricultural land use and spectral similarities between cropland, pasture, and natural savanna vegetation. In this study, we investigated the potential to reliably separate cropland, pasture, natural savanna vegetation, and other relevant land cover classes employing Landsat-derived spectral--temporal variability metrics for a savanna landscape in the Brazilian Cerrado. In order to better understand the surplus value and limitations of spectral--temporal variability metrics for classification purposes, we analyzed four datasets of different temporal depth, using 344 Landsat scenes across four footprints between 2009 and 2012. Our results showed a reliable separation between cropland, pasture, and natural savanna vegetation achieving an adjusted overall accuracy of 93{\%}. A similar accuracy and spatial consistency of LULC classification could not be achieved based on spectral information alone, indicating the high additional value of temporal information for identifying LULC classes in the complex land use systems of savanna landscapes. There is great potential for transferring our approach to other savanna systems which still suffer from inaccurate LULC information.},

@article{Noss.1990,
 abstract = {Abstract:  Biodiversity is presently a minor consideration in environmental policy. It has been regarded as too broad and vague a concept to be applied to real-world regulatory and management problems. This problem can be corrected if biodiversity is recognized as an end in itself, and if measurable indicators can be selected to assess the status of biodiversity over time. Biodiversity, as presently understood, encompasses multiple levels of biological organization. In this paper, I expand the three primary attributes of biodiversity recognized by Jerry Franklin --- composition, structure, and function---into a nested hierarchy that incorporates elements of each attribute at four levels of organization: regional landscape, community-ecosystem, population-species, and genetic. Indicators of each attribute in terrestrial ecosystems, at the four levels of organization, are identified for environmental monitoring purposes. Projects to monitor biodiversity will benefit from a direct linkage to long-term ecological research and a commitment to test hypotheses relevant to biodiversity conservation. A general guideline is to proceed from the top down, beginning with a coarse-scale inventory of landscape pattern, vegetation, habitat structure, and species distributions, then overlaying data on stress levels to identify biologically significant areas at high risk of impoverishment. Intensive research and monitoring can be directed to high-risk ecosystems and elements of biodiversity, while less intensive monitoring is directed to the total landscape (or samples thereof). In any monitoring program, particular attention should be paid to specifying the questions that monitoring is intended to answer and validating the relationships between indicators and the components of biodiversity they represent.



Resumen:  La biodiversidad es hasta ahora una consid-eraci{\'o}n menor en lapolitica ambiental. Se ha visto como un concepto demasiado amplio y vago para ser aplicado en las regulaciones y el manejo de los problemas del mundo real. Este problema se puede corregir si la biodiversidad es reconocida como unfinporsi misma, y si se pueden seleccionar indicadores cuantificables para determinar el estado de la biodiversidad a trav{\'e}s del tiempo. La biodiversidad, como se entiende actualmente comprende m{\'u}ltiples niveles de organizaci{\'o}n biol{\'o}gica En esta disertaci{\'o}n, extiendo los tres atributos primarios de la biodiversidad reconocidos por Jerry Franklin --- composici{\'o}n, estructura y funci{\'o}n --- dentro de unajerarquia que encaja a incorpora los elementos de cada uno de los atributos en cuatro niveles de organizaci{\'o}n: paisaje regional, ecosistemas de las comunidades, poblaci{\'o}n de especies y gen{\'e}tica Los indicadores de cada atributo en los ecosistemas terrestres, en los cuatro niveles de organizaci{\'o}n, son identificados para prop{\'o}sitos de monitoreo ambiental. Los proyectos para el monitoreo de la biodiversidad se beneficiarian de una uni{\'o}n directa con la investigaci{\'o}n ecol{\'o}gica a laqo plazo y de un compromiso paraprobar hip{\'o}tesis relevantes a la consmacidn de la biodiversidact. Un lineamiento general es proceder de arriba para abajo, empezando con una escala-burda de inventario de los patrones del paisaje, de la vegetaci{\'o}n, de la estructura del h{\'a}bitat y de la distribuci{\'o}n de ls especies, despu{\'e}s super-poner los datos sobre niveles de presi{\'o}n para identificar las areas da alto riezgo y de empobrecimiento. La investigaci{\'o}n intensive y el monitorio peude ser dirigido a los ecosistemas de alto riezgo y a los elementos de la biodiversidad, mientras que un monitoreo m{\'e}nos intenso se puede dirigir a1 total del paisaje (O a muestras del mismo). En cualquier programa de monitoreo, se debe de poner atenci{\'o}n especial a1 estar espe-cificando las preguntas que el monitoreo pretende resolver y al estar validando las relaciones entre los indicadores y los componentes de la biodiversidad que representen.},

@article{Noss.1999,
 abstract = {Enlightened forest management requires reliable information on the status and condition of each forest -- interpreted from a broad context -- and of change in forest conditions over time. The process of forest planning must begin with a clear statement of goals, from which detailed objectives and management plans follow. Goals and objectives for forest management should reflect the conservation value of a forest relative to other forests of the same general type. This paper reviews some recent assessments (with emphasis on North America), presents a framework for forest assessment and monitoring, and suggests some indicators of biodiversity in forests. Among the broad assessments of forest status and conservation value are a global `forest frontiers' assessment by the World Resources Institute, gap analysis projects that assess the level of representation of forests and other communities in protected areas, and ecoregion-based conservation assessments conducted by the World Wildlife Fund. Also important is information on change in forest area and condition over time. Among the common changes in forests over the past two centuries are loss of old forests, simplification of forest structure, decreasing size of forest patches, increasing isolation of patches, disruption of natural fire regimes, and increased road building, all of which have had negative effects on native biodiversity. These trends can be reversed, or at least slowed, through better management. Progress toward forest recovery can be measured through the use of ecological indicators that correspond to the specific conditions and trends of concern. Although there is a wealth of indicators to choose from, most have been poorly tested and require rigorous validation in order to be interpreted with confidence.},

 abstract = {The main study objective was to develop robust processing and analysis

techniques to facilitate the use of small-footprint lidar data for

estimating plot-level tree height by measuring individual trees

identifiable on the three-dimensional lidar surface. Lidar processing

techniques included data fusion with multispectral optical data and

local filtering with both square and circular windows of variable size.

The lidar system used for this study produced an average footprint of

0.65 m and an average distance between laser shots of 0.7 m. The lidar

data set was acquired over deciduous and coniferous stands with settings

typical of the southeastern United States. The lidar-derived tree

measurements were used with regression models and cross-validation to

estimate tree height on 0.017-ha plots. For the pine plots, lidar

measurements explained 97 percent of the variance associated with the

mean height of dominant trees. For deciduous plots, regression models

explained 79 percent of the mean height variance for dominant trees.

Filtering for local maximum with circular windows gave better fitting

models for pines, while for deciduous trees, filtering with square

windows provided a slightly better model fit. Using lidar and optical

data fusion to differentiate between forest types provided better

results for estimating average plot height for pines. Estimating tree

height for deciduous plots gave superior results without calibrating the

search window size based on forest type.},

{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}{\#}8722;1.605{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} ({\textless}i{\textgreater}N{\textless}/i{\textgreater}, {\textless}i{\textgreater}d{\textless}/i{\textgreater} = number of stems and quadratic mean diameter, respectively) assumes the same allometric relationship between size and density for a wide spectrum of species

under self-thinning conditions. We re-evaluate this rule based on 28 fully stocked pure stands of common beech ({\textless}i{\textgreater}Fagus sylvatica{\textless}/i{\textgreater} L.), Norway spruce ({\textless}i{\textgreater}Picea abies{\textless}/i{\textgreater} [L.] Karst.), Scots pine ({\textless}i{\textgreater}Pinus sylvestris{\textless}/i{\textgreater} L.), and common oak ({\textless}i{\textgreater}Quercus petraea{\textless}/i{\textgreater} [Mattuschka] Liebl.) in

Germany that date back to the year 1870. OLS regression of the model ln({\textless}i{\textgreater}N{\textless}/i{\textgreater}) = {\textless}i{\textgreater}a{\textless}/i{\textgreater} + {\textless}i{\textgreater}b{\textless}/i{\textgreater} · ln({\textless}i{\textgreater}d{\textless}/i{\textgreater}) results in {\textless}i{\textgreater}b{\textless}/i{\textgreater} values of {\&}{\#}8722;1.789 for common beech, {\&}{\#}8722;1.664 for Norway spruce, {\&}{\#}8722;1.593 for Scots pine, and {\&}{\#}8722;1.424 for common oak.

The allometric coefficient for common beech differs significantly from the other species. There is also a significant difference between the {\textless}i{\textgreater}b{\textless}/i{\textgreater} values of Norway spruce and common oak. Except for Scots pine, the above allometric coefficients deviate significantly (common beech) and close-to-significantly

(Norway spruce, common oak) from the coefficient {\&}{\#}8722;1.605 postulated by Reineke in 1933. To cover the species{\&}{\#}8211;specific oscillation of mortality rates, we additionally calculate the self-thinning coefficient for each survey period. Ecological implications of the species-specific scaling

exponents are stressed and consequences regarding tools for regulating stand density are discussed. FOR. SCI. 51(4):304{\&}{\#}8211;320.},

 abstract = {Forest ecosystems have been exposed to climate change for more than 100 years, whereas the consequences on forest growth remain elusive. Based on the oldest existing experimental forest plots in Central Europe, we show that, currently, the dominant tree species Norway spruce and European beech exhibit significantly faster tree growth (+32 to 77{\%}), stand volume growth (+10 to 30{\%}) and standing stock accumulation (+6 to 7{\%}) than in 1960. Stands still follow similar general allometric rules, but proceed more rapidly through usual trajectories. As forest stands develop faster, tree numbers are currently 17--20{\%} lower than in past same-aged stands. Self-thinning lines remain constant, while growth rates increase indicating the stock of resources have not changed, while growth velocity and turnover have altered. Statistical analyses of the experimental plots, and application of an ecophysiological model, suggest that mainly the rise in temperature and extended growing seasons contribute to increased growth acceleration, particularly on fertile sites.},

 abstract = {A new understanding or by some called a new paradigm of sustainable forest management is in the process of being defined. At the international political level in Europe, this new paradigm was shaped largely by the European states and non-governmental organisations participating in the Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe (MCPFE). This was achieved through agreeing on a common definition and operationalising it through a set of criteria and indicators. This concept is now gradually adapted to different national, regional and local conditions in many countries in Europe, and implementation is attempted. This paper outlines the history of international forest policy, especially of the MCPFE. It outlines the Pan-European understanding of the concept of Sustainable Forest Management (SFM), operationalised through criteria and indicators, and the recent development related to indicators for SFM. It also presents recent political decisions in Pan-European forest policy that are building on and further promote sustainable forest management as their key paradigm. These international forest policy decisions will also guide targets and influence tools for the maintenance of forest biodiversity and cause action on the national and local levels.},

 abstract = {Airborne laser scanning of forests has been shown to provide accurate terrain models and, at the same time, estimates of multiple resource inventory variables through active sensing of three-dimensional (3D) forest vegetation. Brief overviews of airborne laser scanning technology [often referred to as ``light detection and ranging'' (LIDAR)] and research findings on its use in forest measurement and monitoring are presented. Currently, many airborne laser scanning missions are flown with specifications designed for terrain mapping, often resulting in data sets that do not contain key information needed for vegetation measurement. Therefore, standards and specifications for airborne laser scanning missions are needed to insure their usefulness for vegetation measurement and monitoring, rather than simply terrain mapping (e.g., delivery of all return data with reflection intensity). Five simple, easily understood LIDAR-derived forest data products are identified that would help insure that forestry needs are considered when multiresource LIDAR missions are flown. Once standards are developed, there is an opportunity to maximize the value of permanent ground plot remeasurements by also collecting airborne laser data over a limited number of plots each year.},

@article{Rosnell.2012,
 abstract = {The objective of this investigation was to develop and investigate methods for point cloud generation by image matching using aerial image data collected by quadrocopter type micro unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imaging systems. Automatic generation of high-quality, dense point clouds from digital images by image matching is a recent, cutting-edge step forward in digital photogrammetric technology. The major components of the system for point cloud generation are a UAV imaging system, an image data collection process using high image overlaps, and post-processing with image orientation and point cloud generation. Two post-processing approaches were developed: one of the methods is based on Bae Systems' SOCET SET classical commercial photogrammetric software and another is built using Microsoft({\circledR})'s Photosynth{\texttrademark} service available in the Internet. Empirical testing was carried out in two test areas. Photosynth processing showed that it is possible to orient the images and generate point clouds fully automatically without any a priori orientation information or interactive work. The photogrammetric processing line provided dense and accurate point clouds that followed the theoretical principles of photogrammetry, but also some artifacts were detected. The point clouds from the Photosynth processing were sparser and noisier, which is to a large extent due to the fact that the method is not optimized for dense point cloud generation. Careful photogrammetric processing with self-calibration is required to achieve the highest accuracy. Our results demonstrate the high performance potential of the approach and that with rigorous processing it is possible to reach results that are consistent with theory. We also point out several further research topics. Based on theoretical and empirical results, we give recommendations for properties of imaging sensor, data collection and processing of UAV image data to ensure accurate point cloud generation.},

 abstract = {{\dq}R is rapidly growing in popularity as the environment of choice for data analysis and graphics both in academia and industry. Lattice brings the proven design of Trellis graphics (originally developed for S by William S. Cleveland and colleagues at Bell Labs) to R, considerably expanding its capabilities in the process. Lattice is a powerful and elegant high level data visualization system that is sufficient for most everyday graphics needs, yet flexible enough to be easily extended to handle demands of cutting edge research. Written by the author of the lattice system, this book describes it in considerable depth, beginning with the essentials and systematically delving into specific low levels details as necessary. No prior experience with lattice is required to read the book, although basic familiarity with R is assumed.{\dq} {\dq}The book contains close to 150 figures produced with lattice. Many of the examples emphasize principles of good graphical design; almost all use real data sets that are publicly available in various R packages. All code and figures in the book are also available online, along with supplementary material covering more advanced topics.{\dq}--Jacket.},

@article{Schmidt.2014,
 abstract = {The amount of images used in multitemporal classification studies has greatly increased along with enhanced temporal sensor capacities. Handling large intra-annual time series leads to the question of how the selection of image acquisition dates could be optimized. In this study, an empirical approach for evaluating the relative classification power of single acquisition dates is introduced for the differentiation of seminatural grassland vegetation. The main question is how many acquisitions from which phenological origins are preferable to achieve a certain classification accuracy target. The tested time series contains 24 single RapidEye scenes from 2009 to 2011. The vegetation index composites of these images were iteratively classified into different combinations of acquisition dates using the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. The subsequent results were tested for significant accuracy improvements over single acquisition dates. These acquisition dates are subsumed under phenological seasons to evaluate adequate temporal acquisition windows. The results show that a three-scene composite reaches more than 0.8 overall accuracy (OAA). The best tradeoff amount between number of acquisition dates and classification accuracy is achieved using a seven-scene NDVI composite. The most important season for the differentiation of seminatural grassland is early summer (ESu). Full spring (FuS), late summer (LSu), and midsummer (MSu) can also be identified as influential temporal windows for data acquisition.},

@article{Sexton.2009,
 abstract = {Forest canopy height is essential information for many forest management activities and is a critical parameter in models of ecosystem processes. Several methods are available to measure canopy height from single-tree to regional and global scales, but the methods vary widely in their sensitivities, leading to different height estimates even for identical stands. We compare four technologies for estimating canopy height in pine and hardwood forests of the Piedmont region of North Carolina, USA: (1) digital elevation data from the global Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) C-band radar interferometry, (2) X- and P-band radar interferometry from the recently developed airborne Geographic Synthetic Aperture Radar (GeoSAR) sensor, (3) small footprint lidar measurements (in pine only), and (4) field measurements acquired by in situ forest mensuration. Differences between measurements were smaller in pine than in hardwood forests, with biases ranging from 5.13 to 12.17 m in pine (1.60--13.77 m for lidar) compared to 6.60--15.28 m in hardwoods and RMSE from 8.40 to 14.21 m in pine (4.73--14.92 m for lidar) compared to 9.54--16.84 in hardwood. GeoSAR measurements of canopy height were among the most comparable measurements overall and showed potential for successful calibration, with R2 = 0.87 in pine canopies and R2 = 0.38 in hardwood canopies from simple linear regression. An improved calibration based on differential canopy penetration is presented and applied to SRTM measurements, resulting in canopy height estimates in pine forests with RMSE and standard error {\&}lt;4.00 m. Each of the remotely sensed methods studied produces reasonable and consistent depictions of canopy height that can be compared with data of similar provenance, but due to differences in underlying sensitivities between the methods, comparisons between measurements from various sources require cross-calibration and will be most useful at broad scales.},

 abstract = {Imputation is applied for two quite different purposes: to supply missing data to complete a data set for subsequent modeling analyses or to estimate subpopulation totals. Error properties of the imputed values have different effects in these two contexts. We partition errors of imputation derived from similar observation units as arising from three sources: observation error, the distribution of observation units with respect to their similarity, and pure error given a particular choice of variables known for all observation units. Two new statistics based on this partitioning measure the accuracy of the imputations, facilitating comparison of imputation to alternative methods of estimation such as regression and comparison of alternative methods of imputation generally. Knowing the relative magnitude of the errors arising from these partitions can also guide efficient investment in obtaining additional data. We illustrate this partitioning using three extensive data sets from western North America. Application of this partitioning to compare near-neighbor imputation is illustrated for Mahalanobis- and two canonical correlation-based measures of similarity.},

@article{Stenzel.2014,
 abstract = {Abstract

Mapping of habitats with relevance for nature conservation involves the identification of patches of target habitats in a complex mosaic of vegetation types not relevant for conservation planning. Limiting the necessary ground reference to a small sample of target habitats would greatly reduce and therefore support the field mapping effort. We thus aim to answer in this study the question: can semi-automated remote sensing methods help to map such patches without the need of ground references from sites not relevant for nature conservation? Approaches able to fulfill this task may help to improve the efficiency of large scale mapping and monitoring programs such as requested for the European Habitat Directive.

In the present study, we used the maximum-entropy based classification approach Maxent to map four habitat types across a patchy landscape of 1000 km2 near Munich, Germany. This task was conducted using the low number of 125 ground reference points only along with easily available multi-seasonal RapidEye satellite imagery. Encountered problems include the non-stationarity of habitat reflectance due to different phenological development across space, continuous transitions between the habitats and the need for improved methods for detailed validation.

The result of the tested approach is a habitat map with an overall accuracy of 70{\%}. The rather simple and affordable approach can thus be recommended for a first survey of previously unmapped areas, as a tool for identifying potential gaps in existing habitat inventories and as a first check for changes in the distribution of habitats.},

 abstract = {Parameter prediction and the most similar neighbour (MSN) approaches were compared to estimate stand tables from aerial information. The study was based on 50 stands in the southeastern interior of British Columbia, Canada. In the parametric prediction approach, stand tables were estimated from aerial attributes and three percentile points (16.7, 63 and 97{\%}) of the diameter distribution. In the MSN analysis, stand tables were estimated from the MSN stand that was selected using 13 ground and 22 aerial variables. The accuracy of these approaches was evaluated by comparing the observed and estimated species composition, stand tables and volume per hectare. While the parametric prediction approach is easier and flexible to apply, the MSN approach provided reasonable projections, lower bias and lower root mean square error. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

 abstract = {Abstract

A key requirement of sustainable forest management is accurate, timely, and comprehensive information on forest resources, which is provided through forest inventories. In Canada, forest inventories are conventionally undertaken through the delineation and interpretation of forest stands using aerial photography, supported by data from permanent and temporary sample plots. In recent years, Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data have been shown to provide accurate estimates of a range of forest structural attributes. As a result, ALS has emerged as an increasingly common data source for enhanced forest inventory programs. Capture of species compositional information with ALS, based upon the nature of the data, is less reliable than structural variables, with species information typically derived from spectral or textural interpretation of aerial photography or very high spatial resolution digital imagery. Utilizing national allometric equations for the major species found in British Columbia, Canada, and a series of individual tree-level simulations, we analyzed (i) how incorrect species identification can influence individual tree volume prediction; (ii) which of the possible species substitutions result in higher volume errors; (iii) how the error in height that is typical for photogrammetry-based and ALS-based forest inventories impacts individual tree volume estimates; and (iv) the impact of combined errors in both species composition and height on overall individual tree volume estimates. Our results indicate that species information is important for volume calculations, and that the use of generic (i.e. all species) or cover-type allometric equations can lead to large errors in volume estimates. We also found that, even with a 50{\%} error in species composition (whereby incorrect species-specific equations are substituted), volume estimates derived from species-specific allometric equations were more accurate than estimates derived from generic or cover-type equations. Our findings indicate that errors in species composition have less impact on individual tree volume estimates than errors in height measurement. The implications of these results are that, with very accurate estimates of height provided by ALS and knowledge of what dominant species is expected in a stand, accurate estimates of volume can be generated in the absence of more detailed species composition information.},

 abstract = {The geometric features of agricultural trees such as canopy area, tree height and crown volume provide useful information about plantation status and crop production. However, these variables are mostly estimated after a time-consuming and hard field work and applying equations that treat the trees as geometric solids, which produce inconsistent results. As an alternative, this work presents an innovative procedure for computing the 3-dimensional geometric features of individual trees and tree-rows by applying two consecutive phases: 1) generation of Digital Surface Models with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology and 2) use of object-based image analysis techniques. Our UAV-based procedure produced successful results both in single-tree and in tree-row plantations, reporting up to 97{\%} accuracy on area quantification and minimal deviations compared to in-field estimations of tree heights and crown volumes. The maps generated could be used to understand the linkages between tree grown and field-related factors or to optimize crop management operations in the context of precision agriculture with relevant agro-environmental implications.},

@article{vanLeeuwen.2013,
 abstract = {Abstract

Understanding canopy radiation regimes is critical to successfully modeling vegetation growth and function. For instance, the vertical distribution of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) affects vegetation growth, informative upon carbon and energy cycling. Availing upon advances in information capture and computing power, geometrically explicit modeling of forest structure becomes increasingly possible. A primary challenge however is acquiring the forest mensuration data required to parameterize these models and the related automation of modeling forest structure. In this research, to address these issues we employ a novel and automated approach that capitalizes upon the rich information afforded by ground-based laser scanning technology. The method is implemented in two steps: in the first step, geometric explicit models of canopy structure are created from the ground-based laser scanning data. These geometric explicit models are used to simulate the vertical range to first hit. In the second step, we derive canopy gap probability from full waveform laser scanning data which have been used in a number of studies for characterization of radiation transmission (Jupp et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2010) and do not require any geometric explicit modeling. The radiative consistency of the geometric explicit models from step 1 is validated against the gap probabilities of step 2. The results show a strong relationship between the radiative transmission properties of the geometric models and canopy gap probabilities at plot level (R = 0.91 to 0.97), while the geometric models suggest the additional benefit to serve as a bridge in scaling between shoot level and canopy level radiation.},

 abstract = {Site index (SI) is one of the main measures of forest productivity in North America. For monospecific even-age stands, it is defined as the height of dominant trees at a given reference age or presented as an age--height curve. SI normally reflects the overall effect of all the environmental parameters that determine height growth locally. However, measuring SI can only be achieved though field observations and is, for this reason, limited to sample plots. In this study, we propose a new method for quantifying and mapping SI and age based on known age--height curves and time series of canopy height models (CHMs) produced using digital photogrammetry and lidar. Digital surface models (DSMs) are created by applying an automated stereo-matching algorithm to scanned aerial photographs. The canopy height is obtained by subtracting the lidar ground elevations from the DSM. Using aerial photographs covering the 1945--2003 interval and a recent lidar coverage, CHMs could be reconstructed retrospectively for a period of over 58 years. Regionally calibrated age--height curves were fitted to observations that were extracted cell-wise from the historical CHMs to estimate SI and age values for all undisturbed locations. Results demonstrate that SI and age of jack pine (Pinus banksiana [Lamb.]) stands can be quantified respectively with an average bias of 0.76 m (2.41 m root mean squared error, RMSE) and 1.86 years (7 years RMSE). The method can be used to produce quasi-continuous maps of SI and age and to estimate productivity in a spatially explicit way.},

 abstract = {Abstract

This paper introduces PTrees, a multi-scale dynamic point cloud segmentation dedicated to forest tree extraction from lidar point clouds. The method process the point data using the raw elevation values (Z) and compute height (H = Z $-$ ground elevation) during post-processing using an innovative procedure allowing to preserve the geometry of crown points. Multiple segmentations are done at different scales. Segmentation criteria are then applied to dynamically select the best set of apices from the tree segments extracted at the various scales. The selected set of apices is then used to generate a final segmentation. PTrees has been tested in 3 different forest types, allowing to detect 82{\%} of the trees with under 10{\%} of false detection rate. Future development will integrate crown profile estimation during the segmentation process in order to both maximize the detection of suppressed trees and minimize false detections.},

@inproceedings{Wallerman.2012,
 abstract = {The increasing availability of accurate Digital Elevation Models (DEMs)

of nation-wide cover has opened new possibilities to produce accurate

forest variable estimation using 3D data acquired from aerial imagery.

Such data can be produced by automatic matching of stereo images and

photogrammetric modeling of the forest canopy height. Using existing

accurate DEM information, the forest canopy height above ground is then

easily assessed. Today, Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) is frequently used

to capture data for accurate estimation of variables to be used in

forest management planning. Recent studies in Scandinavia show

estimation accuracies almost as accurate as ALS, using 3D data obtained

from standard aerial imagery, at least for the most important forest

variables. So far mainly area-based estimation methods at field plot or

raster cell level have been studied.

This paper reports early results from applying a single-tree modeling

approach, corresponding to the Semi-ITC (Individual Tree Crown) method,

commonly used in ALS-based applications, using 3D data acquired from

aerial DMC imagery. Here, a simplified Semi-ITC method was used to

estimate tree height at segment level. The Root Mean Square Error of

estimating the maximum tree height was 34{\%} (of the true mean maximum

tree height). Clearly, the methodology used shows promising results and

has potential to be used in forest management planning.},

 abstract = {AbstractCharacterization of ecosystem structure, diversity, and function is increasingly desired at finer spatial and temporal scales than have been derived in the past. Many ecological applications require detailed data representing large spatial extents, but these data are often unavailable or are impractical to gather using field-based techniques. Remote sensing offers an option for collecting data that can represent broad spatial extents with detailed attribute characterizations. Remotely sensed data are also appropriate for use in studies across spatial scales, in conjunction with field-collected data. This article presents the pertinent technical aspects of remote sensing for images at high spatial resolution (i.e., with a pixel size of 16 square meters or less), existing and future options for the processing and analysis of remotely sensed data, and attributes that can be estimated with these data for forest ecosystems.},

@article{Wulder.2012c,
 abstract = {The ability to use digital remotely sensed data for forest inventory is often limited by the nature of the measures, which, with the exception of multi-angular or stereo observations, are largely insensitive to vertically distributed attributes. As a result, empirical estimates are typically made to characterize attributes such as height, volume, or biomass, with known asymptotic relationships as signal saturation occurs. Lidar (light detection and ranging) has emerged as a robust means to collect and subsequently characterize vertically distributed attributes. Lidar has been established as an appropriate data source for forest inventory purposes; however, large area monitoring and mapping activities with lidar remain challenging due to the logistics, costs, and data volumes involved.

The use of lidar as a sampling tool for large-area estimation may mitigate some or all of these problems. A number of factors drive, and are common to, the use of airborne profiling, airborne scanning, and spaceborne lidar systems as sampling tools for measuring and monitoring forest resources across areas that range in size from tens of thousands to millions of square kilometers. In this communication, we present the case for lidar sampling as a means to enable timely and robust large-area characterizations. We briefly outline the nature of different lidar systems and data, followed by the theoretical and statistical underpinnings for lidar sampling. Current applications are presented and the future potential of using lidar in an integrated sampling framework for large area ecosystem characterization and monitoring is presented. We also include recommendations regarding statistics, lidar sampling schemes, applications (including data integration and stratification), and subsequent information generation.},

@article{Wulder.2013,
 abstract = {The science associated with the use of airborne and satellite Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) to remotely sense forest structure has rapidly progressed over the past decade. LiDAR has evolved from being a poorly understood, potentially useful tool to an operational technology in a little over a decade, and these instruments have become a major success story in terms of their application to the measurement, mapping, or monitoring of forests worldwide. Invented in 1960, the laser and, a short time later, LiDAR, were found in research and military laboratories. Since the early 2000s, commercial technological developments coupled with an improved understanding of how to manipulate and analyze large amounts of collected data enabled notable scientific and application developments. A diversity of rapidly developing fields especially benefit from communications offered through conferences such as SilviLaser, and LiDAR has been no different. In 2002 the SilviLaser conference series was initiated to bring together those interested in the development and application of LiDAR for forested environments. Now, a little over a decade later, commercial use of LiDAR is common. In this paper -- using the deliberations of SilviLaser 2012 as a source of information -- we aim to capture aspects of importance to LiDAR users in the forest ecosystems community and to also point to key emerging issues as well as some remaining challenges.},

@article{Yu.2006,
 abstract = {This paper analyzes the potential of airborne laser scanner data for

measuring individual tree height growth in a boreal forest using 82

sample trees of Scots pine. Point clouds (10 points/m(2), beam size 40

cm) illuminating 50 percent of the treetops were acquired in September

1998 and May 2003 with the Toposys 83 kHz lidar system. The reference

height and height growth of pines were measured with a tacheometer in

the field. Three different types of features were extracted from the

point clouds representing each tree; they were the difference between

the highest z values, the difference between the DSMS of the tree crown,

and the differences between the 85(th), 90(th) and 95(th) percentiles of

the canopy height histograms corresponding to the crown. The best

correspondence with the field measurements was achieved with an R-2

value of 0.68 and a RMSE of 43 cm. The results indicate that it is

possible to measure the growth of an individual tree with multi-temporal

laser surveys. We also demonstrated a new algorithm for tree-to-tree

matching. It is needed in operational growth estimation based on

individual trees, especially in dense spruce forests. The method is

based on minimizing the distances between treetops in the N-dimensional

data space. The experiments showed that the use of the location (derived

from laser data) and height of the trees were together adequate to

provide reliable tree-to-tree matching. In the future, a fourth

dimension (the crown area) should also be included in the matching.},

@article{Zeide.1985,
 abstract = {The fact that tolerant species survive better than intolerants in mixed stands does not mean that in pure stands tolerants have less mortality than intolerants. Tolerance is not necessarily associated with self-tolerance which can be defined as the ability of trees to grow and to survive under the stress of intraspecific competition. The relative rate of volume growth with respect to the decrease of the number of trees captures both processes involved in the definition of self-tolerance (growth and mortality) and can be used as its measure. A positive correlation was not found between this measure and tolerance as determined from tolerance tables for southern pines. Therefore, self-tolerance appears to be a quality of stands independent of tolerance.},
